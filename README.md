What is Python  --> Python is high level interpreted programing lang known for its dynamic typing, simplicity and versality.

Meaning of basic terms used above:-

High level --> Human readable lang (need to converted into machine understanding)
Low Level language -> which is written on machine code used by hardware RAM, CPU

Interpreted --> code will executed line by line it will be interpreted by python interpreter and converted into byte code which will then run my machine hardware.
Parsing happens its basically slow 
it can run each and every machine 

complied means --> it will be executed all at once , it is faster example c++,c# languages

Versality ---> It can be used by everyone, clean code , easy readiablity  

Dynamic typing --> it already assumes the data type 
ex in c ,c++ = int length_of_land =100
but in python 
length_of_land = 100 its stored automatically

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Variable ??

anything that can be changed
ex- if i want to build a house we need length , breadth 
length= 100ft
breadth= 100ft

whenever anything we execute it always run on RAM

how to know where the variable is been stored we can use id(variable_name)- checkout variable.python
Incase when both the variable is pointing towards same value it will be stored into same object

Variable naming convention
- can be used a_z,_ both upper and lower case
- number can be used but not in the starting 
- case sensative
- break ,pass , if keywords should not be used in variable
- camelcasing

What is Data Type
1. Integer 
2. Float
3. String
4. Boolean
